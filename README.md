### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vince from Belgium and i'm currently a final year student studying Electronics - ICT with my specialization of Cloud and Cyber Security. I like to learn about the different operating systems out there like Linux and Windows and how to configure them. Besides i'm passionate about all sorts of IT infrastructure.
